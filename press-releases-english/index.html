<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>VN2020 ORGANISES THE FIRST CAREER NETWORKING EVENT IN<&#47;strong><br />
<strong>SINGAPORE FOR VIETNAMESE COMPANIES<&#47;strong><&#47;p><br />
SINGAPORE &ndash; The Association of Vietnamese Professionals in Singapore (VN2020)&nbsp;organises the first career networking event in Singapore for Vietnamese companies&nbsp;named &ldquo;Gathering Talents, Connecting Business&rdquo; on 23 June, 2012 at the Shaw Foundation&nbsp;Alumni House, National University of Singapore. The event provides a platform for&nbsp;companies in Vietnam to recruit experienced Vietnamese professionals in Singapore as well&nbsp;as network with Singapore-based companies for future business collaboration opportunities .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gathering Talents, Connecting Business&rdquo; was initiated by the Enterprise Family, a sub-&nbsp;group of VN2020 that comprises of over 50 active members sharing the goal to enhance the&nbsp;business relationship between Vietnam and Singapore. The Enterprise Family strategically&nbsp;partners with the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Ho Chi Minh City branch&nbsp;(VCCI-HCM) and the Singapore Business Group (SBG) to approach companies and&nbsp;business associations in Vietnam. The event comprises of Career Fair, Workshops on talents&nbsp;engagement and management, panel discussion on strategic business partnership between&nbsp;Vietnam and Singapore and Networking session with members of the Singapore Chinese&nbsp;Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry and other Singapore-based companies.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Vo Ta Han, founder of VN2020: &ldquo;Vietnam just passed the preparation&nbsp;phase of its global economic integration and is now ready to take-off. During this stage of&nbsp;economic development, human resources play an important role for companies in Vietnam.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Singapore has been considered as the ideal place to nurture Vietnamese talents.&nbsp;Among many Vietnamese communities all over the world, the Vietnamese community in&nbsp;Singapore comprises the most highly-qualified people. Also, this community is young and&nbsp;geographically close to Vietnam. I believe that the &ldquo;Gathering Talents, Connecting Business&rdquo;&nbsp;event will provide an excellent opportunity for both sides to meet and understand more about&nbsp;each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Dau Van Huan, Project Director of the event, said: &ldquo;The past 10 years witnessed a regular&nbsp;increase in the number of Vietnamese students studying in Singapore. Statistics show that&nbsp;there has been around 8,000 Vietnamese students graduating from Singapore universities and&nbsp;most of them are staying working in MNCs in Singapore. Based on the survey conducted by&nbsp;the Enterprise Family, many Vietnamese professional in Singapore plan to go back and work&nbsp;in Vietnam in the future. At the same time, the demand to attract internationally experienced&nbsp;Vietnamese professionals among companies in Vietnam is increasing. This has motivated&nbsp;VN2020 Enterprise Family to organise this event for both sides to meet and discuss directly,&nbsp;creating more opportunities to strengthen business in Vietnam.&rdquo;</p>
