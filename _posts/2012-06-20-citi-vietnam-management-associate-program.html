<p><strong>The Program<&#47;strong></p>
<p>The Management Associate (MA) Program is tailored to develop you as a high-potential individual for leadership roles in Citibank Vietnam. Upon entering the Program, you will not only acquire advanced banking knowledge, but also the leadership and interpersonal skills that enable you to maximize your potential early and to define your own career.</p>
<p>The Vietnam Management Associate Program is a 24 month program and is structured as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Year 1, 3 x 4 month rotations<br />
&bull; Year 2, 12 month assignment</p>
<p>In addition you will be given class room training, opportunities to interact with Senior Leaders, MA assignments, assigned buddies and mentors to support you throughout the program. By giving you exposure and insight into the different business areas, it will give you an opportunity not only to see how those areas work, but to develop your people and relationship skills in order to build a network of contacts &ndash; which will be very useful as you move through the organization.</p>
<p>At the end of the program, you will be assigned to one business. The assignment is based on a combination of your personal preferences and business needs. We appreciate that earlier in your career it is harder to pin point where you want to work. The structure of the program means that you will have the opportunity to explore different areas before making your final decision.</p>
